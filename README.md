#	Hunger Games programming / game theory competition engine
This is a Ruby implementation of the rules used by [Brilliant's Hunger Games competition](https://brilliant.org/competitions/hunger-games/).  
  
Competitors should create a class inheriting from `HungerGames::Player` and implementing the methods
stubbed out in that class. They should be able to initialize with no arguments. Place these class
definitions in the lib/ directory and they will be found automatically.
  
To run the competition in a browser, run `ruby web_runner.rb` from the project root.
